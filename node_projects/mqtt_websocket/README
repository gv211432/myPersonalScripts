========================== INTRO =============================

The goal of this project is to translate the incoming mqtt to websocket and vice-versa.

As I tried alot to directly communicate from react native app using mqtt protocol I was
unsuccessful..

I decided to build websocket connection with react native app and mqtt connection with
machine.

And just leverage the both connection in communicating with each other.

Its also helpful in implementing more rules and filteration and function on server itself..

======================= Functions ===============================
